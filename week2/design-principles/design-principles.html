        <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>    <!-- the principle's title -->
        <p class="sitename">My Fitness Pal</p>   <!-- the organization/company name -->
        <a href="http://blog.myfitnesspal.com" target="_blank">blog.myfitnesspal.com</a>   <!-- the web site address as a external hyperlink -->

        <p class="description">I thought 'proximity' was harder to find on the mobile sites. I chose this section of this site because of the headings and lines separating the sections. This shows proximity grouping because several related articles are under each heading. This layout also creates a visual hierarchy with related articles being grouped under a heading.</p>    <!-- brief description on how the design principle is exemplified on the page -->

      <div class="principle alignment">
        <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>    <!-- the principle's title -->

        <p class="description">A grid is a structure made up of columns and/or rows to help us visually map out our content. This section of the site actually shows a combination of two types of grids, column and modular. Columns are one of the most commonly used grids. The column, in this case, runs along the left-hand side. Modular grids have columns and rows. This is shown in the rest of the picture.</p>    <!-- brief description on how the design principle is exemplified on the page -->

      <div class="principle repitition">
        <h3>PARC: Repitition</h3>    <!-- the principle's title -->
        <p class="sitename">Sitepoint</p>   <!-- the organization/company name -->
        <a href="http://sitepoint.com" target="_blank">sitepoint.com</a>   <!-- the web site address as a external hyperlink -->

        </figure>    <!-- a mobile view screenshot -->
        <p class="description">Repitition is the accurate repeating or reusing of aspects of a design (color, spacing, lines, shapes, etc.) throughout the piece. Repeating shapes can also act as containers where information will be placed. This screenshot shows shapes, rectangles and squares, being repeated to display items offered and their links.</p>    <!-- brief description on how the design principle is exemplified on the page -->
      </div>

      <div class="principle contrast">
        <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>    <!-- the principle's title -->

        </figure>    <!-- a mobile view screenshot -->
        <p class="description">Contrast is the visual difference between elements that makes it distinguishable among like elements and the background. It is something that stands out or looks different from the others. The contrast in this screenshot is the yellow. The rest of the page has a white background with smaller blue boxes and links.</p>    <!-- brief description on how the design principle is exemplified on the page -->
